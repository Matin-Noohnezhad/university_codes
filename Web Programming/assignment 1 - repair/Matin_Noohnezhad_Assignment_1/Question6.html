<blockquote>
    James Harden squinted under the bright lights of the Toyota Center court on Thursday and parts of both eyes remained a garish, bloody red.

    It was clear Houston's superstar was still dealing with injuries to his eyes after being hit by Golden State's Draymond Green in Game 2. Harden insisted the problem wouldn't keep him out of Game 3 on Saturday  (8:30 ET, ABC) as the Rockets try to climb out of an 0-2 series hole against the defending champions.

    Harden practiced with the Rockets today despite injuries to both of his eyes.

    It was clear that last year's MVP was still struggling as he squinted under the light while answering questions about it. The entire left side of his left eye remained bloody, as did the left corner of his right eye.

    "If I played barely seeing last game, what makes you think I'm going to sit out Game 3," Harden asked defiantly.

    Harden was injured midway through the first quarter Sunday night after an inadvertent blow to the face from Green as he tried to rebound a shot he missed. He immediately fell to the court where he remained writhing for a bit before he was tended to by Houston's training staff and taken to the locker room. He returned with about seven minutes left in the second quarter and scored 29 points despite saying that his vision was extremely blurry and that he could see "nothing."
